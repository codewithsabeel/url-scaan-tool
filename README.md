# Python Malicious Scanner Tool

This is a Python tool for scanning URLs and IP addresses for malicious activity using the VirusTotal API. It is designed for cybersecurity purposes to help identify potentially harmful links or IPs.

## Features

- Scan URLs for malicious content.
- Scan IP addresses for suspicious activity.
- Uses the VirusTotal public API for threat intelligence.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- A VirusTotal API key (free registration at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/))

## Usage

1. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in `python scaaningtool.py` with your actual VirusTotal API key.

2. Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python python\ scaaningtool.py <type> <value>
```

- `<type>`: `url` or `ip`
- `<value>`: The URL or IP address to scan

Example:

```bash
python python\ scaaningtool.py url http://example.com
python python\ scaaningtool.py ip 8.8.8.8
```

## Notes

- The tool submits the URL or IP to VirusTotal and retrieves the scan report.
- API rate limits apply based on your VirusTotal account type.
- Ensure you handle your API key securely and do not share it publicly.
